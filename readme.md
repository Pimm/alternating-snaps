# Alternating snaps

## Concept

_Alternating snaps_ are snap fasteners or _press studs_ which prevent a dresser from connecting a male half to the wrong female half. The shape of the connection between the two halves of a snap is different from that of each and every adjoining snap.

With traditional snaps a dresser can accidentally skip a female half and connect a male half to the next female half, or the other way around (skip a male half and connect a female half to the next male half).

Alternating snaps prevent a dresser from making this mistake. A male half can not be connected to the next female half, as those two will have differently shaped connections in every case. The most obvious implementation is having two different connection shapes (such as a circle and a slightly smaller circle) and alternate those two.

As merely the connecting part of the snaps have to be distinct, the front (visible) part can be consistent. Alternating snaps can therefore look like traditional snaps while connected.
